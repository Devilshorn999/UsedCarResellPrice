This repository consist of two deployables one for python anywhere and one for heroku. I ran in some trouble with heroku so you can try to fix it.
But pythonanywhere is a deployable ready folder.

If you want the best model you can run the jupyter notebook on your system and once it has completed running you will have the models on you system.
The dataset for the same can be found on kaggle.
